Usage for P-Distance Calculator:

basic (alignment & subset in files:
    ./pd -aln <aln_path> -sub <sub_path> -n_sub <# seqs>
       
Required Options:
    -aln        path to FASTA file containing the alignment. If this is
                not given, alignment sequences are assumed to come via
                STDIN. If the alignment comes via stdin, nothing else 
                can be given via STDIN. 
            
    -sub        path to file containing a subset of sequences to be
                used for the computation. File should be one sequence
                name per line, separated by newlines. Specified 
                sequences that are not actually in the fasta are 
                ignored. If the alignment file is provided as a path,
                this can be omitted and given through STDIN.
            
    -n_sub      Number of sequences in the subset list. If omitted,
                calculates p-dist on the whole file. If this is not 
                given, the subset file will not be used at all.

Additional Flags:                
    -max        outputs the maximum p-distance instead of the average
                pairwise. (default: off)
            
    -verbose    if given, program prints several intermediate values to
                stdout. This includes counts of total gapped residues 
                and total matching residues, as well as the "weighted"
                p-distance (rather than averaging all the pairwise PDs).
    
    -debug      Goes into debug mode, prints some stuff and then exits.
                Currently does a small unit test to make sure reading 
                the sequences was working. (default: off)
            
    -h          Prints this help description and then terminates
